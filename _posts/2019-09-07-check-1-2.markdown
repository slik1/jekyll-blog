Just wanted to document all the challenges and solutions I've encountered while building my first Angular 8 app using Drupal 7 as a headless CMS to interface with via the Services module and a RESTful API. 

I'll post a link to both the Drupal Github repo and Angular app Github repo soon...


{% highlight javascript %}

// this function right here took awhile...

checkAuthenticationStatus(){
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}
